**Abstract:**

Preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure or destruction of data is gaining importance in the Digital world. Steganography and data hiding have become necessary for information security. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. 

The paper referenced has proposed a secure video steganography algorithm using linear block code. The algorithm requires a video to be converted into frames and changing the pixel positions. The message which is to be transmitted must be converted into one-dimension, XOR and Hamming code are applied to this message. Then this encoded message is embedded in the scrambled video frames. These frames are reconstructed and sent to the receiver. The receiver can extract information using the same key as the sender side. The receiver has to disassemble the video, use XOR and hamming code to reconstruct the correct intended message.


**Objectives:**
* Implement the following in MATLAB:
    
    At sender's side:

    * Conversion of video frames into a YUV format.

    * Applying (7, 4) Hamming code to 1D structure of message which is a image to obtain the codeword.

    * Embedding the message codeword into the video frames.

    * Recontruct the video from the frames.

    At receiver's side:

    * Split the received video into frames and convert them to YUV format.

    * Retrieve back the message codeword from the frames.

    * Retrieve back original message from the message codeword by using decoding for hamming code.

## Usage

* Specify the video to be used in the files: `main.m` and  `frames_to_video.m` 

* Specify the key to be used in the file `main.m`

* Run the following files in order 
    1. `main.m` : In the `frames` directory the following would be present
        * `framesRGB` : RGB frames of the video `small.mp4` or `large.mp4`
        * `framesY` : srambled Y components for RGB frames
        * `framesU` : srambled U components for RGB frames
        * `framesV` : srambled V components for RGB frames

    2. `embed_message.m` : The binary image `message.png` will be embedded into the scrambled Y, U, V components. 

    3. `combine_frames.m` : In the directory `frames\embeddedFramesRGB`, the embedded RGB frames will be created.

    4. `frames_to_video.m` : Video named `em_small.avi` will be created from the embedded RGB frames.

    5. `receiver_retrieve.m` : From the video `em_small.avi` the message will be constructed back and displayed.

    6. `psnr.m` : Displays the PSNR value comparing the original and retrieved image message.


## Results

Original message:

<img src="message.png" width="200px"><br><br>

* Using `large.mp4` the retrieved message is:

<img src="images/r_message_large.png" width="200px"><br><br>

* Using `small.mp4` the retrieved message is:

<img src="images/r_message_small.png" width="200px"><br>
